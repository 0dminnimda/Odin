# Odin Roadmap

Not in any particular order

* Compile Time Execution (CTE)
	- More metaprogramming madness
	- Compiler as a library
	- AST inspection and modification
* CTE-based build system
* Replace LLVM backend with my own custom backend
* Improve SSA design to accommodate for lowering to a "bytecode"
* SSA optimizations
* Parametric Polymorphism
