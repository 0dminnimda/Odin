# Odin Roadmap

Not in any particular order

* Compile Time Execution (CTE)
	- More metaprogramming madness
	- Compiler as a library
	- AST inspection and modification
* CTE-based build system
* Replace LLVM backend with my own custom backend
* Improve SSA design to accommodate for lowering to a "bytecode"
* SSA optimizations
* Parametric Polymorphism
* Documentation Generator for "Entities"
* Multiple Architecture support
* Linking Options
	- Executable
	- Static/Dynamic Library
* Debug Information
	- pdb format too
* Command Line Tooling
* Compiler Internals:
	- Big numbers library
	- Cyclic Type Checking (at the moment will cause compiler to go into an infinite loop)
